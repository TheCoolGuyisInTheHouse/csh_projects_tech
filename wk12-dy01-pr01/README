## Design Choices

- Set the Quiz's font to 14 pt instead of manually setting each control's font.
- Most controls are anchored to the top left corner of the Form, but btnSubmit    
is anchored to the center of the bottom of the form, and btnNext is anchored    
to the bottom right corner.
- Beginning text on Radio Buttons are unnecessary and unprofessional.
- int userAnswer was chosen to be zero if there is no answer, and 1-4
if a current answer is locked in.
- Used another thread to start one application before closing another.  
This helped circumvent the limitation to one thread.

## Assumptions
- None
